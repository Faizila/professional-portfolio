# professional-portfolio

This project is a collection of my work to showcase my experience, capability and potential.

I have used HTML & advanced CSS properties to make a professional portfolio page.

It has a name on the top of the page, followed by a picture.

It has three tabs on the top right corner About Me, My Work & Contact Me. Once clicked, it leads the user to the corresponding section on the page.

About Me section tells the user about who I am as a person.

My work section lets the user visit the live website of my work. Once clicked on any language tab in that section, the link will take user to the corresponding website.

Contact Me section has three buttons at top center Phone, Linkedin and Github follwed by a contact form. User can hover over the phone button for my contact number or click Linkedin/Github buttons to checkout my profile on Linkedin or Github. User can also fill out the form to reach me through the portfolio page via email message.
