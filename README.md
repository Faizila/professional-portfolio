# Description

* Portfolio page showcases the skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. It highlights the strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

* I have used HTML & advanced CSS properties to make a professional portfolio page.

* Portfolio page has my name on the top of the page, followed by my picture.

* It has three tabs on the top right corner About Me, My Work & Contact Me. Once clicked, it leads the user to the corresponding section on that page.

* About Me section tells the user about who I am as a person.

* My work section lets the user visit the deployed application. Once clicked on any titled language logo image, the link will take user to the corresponding webpage.

* Contact Me section has three buttons under the title of the page: Phone, Linkedin and Github followed by a contact form. User can hover over the phone button for my contact number or click Linkedin/Github buttons to checkout my profile on Linkedin or Github. User can also fill out the form to reach me through the portfolio page via email message.
